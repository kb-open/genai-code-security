# Secure AI Coding Framework  

## Overview  
This repository provides a secure AI-driven coding framework that enhances the security of AI-generated code. The project fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) on security-audited datasets, applies reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to penalize insecure patterns, and integrates automated security scanning using CodeQL and SonarQube.  

## Features  
- **Fine-Tuning on Security-Audited Datasets**: Uses OWASP Benchmark and SARD datasets for training.  
- **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Penalizes insecure coding practices, including command injection, SQL injection, and weak cryptography.  
- **Automated Security Scanning**: Integrates CodeQL and SonarQube to detect and block insecure code suggestions.  

## Installation  
### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8+  
- pip package manager  
- CodeQL & SonarQube installed  

### Install Dependencies  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-ai-coding.git
cd secure-ai-coding
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage  
### Fine-Tune the Model  
```bash
python train.py
```

### Run Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) 
```bash
python rlhf.py
```

### Run Security Scan
```bash
python security_scan.py --file path/to/code.py
```

## Security Policies
- The system penalizes AI-generated code that includes:
    - eval() and exec() (arbitrary code execution)
    - subprocess.run() without sanitization
    - Hardcoded credentials
    - Weak cryptographic implementations
    - SQL injection vulnerabilities
